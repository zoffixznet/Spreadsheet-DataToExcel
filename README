Spreadsheet-DataToExcel

L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel> is a marvelous module; however, I would always
find myself digging through the huge doc, not something I enjoy when
all I ever want to do is simply dump my rows/columns centering first
row as well as setting the sizes of columns to just be large enough
to fit all the data. This is where C<Spreadsheet::DataToExcel> comes
in.

If you're looking for any more functionality than
C<Spreadsheet::DataToExcel> offers, please see L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel>.
